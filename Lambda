The Lambda function
Anonymous: Lambda functions do not require a name unless you assign one.
Single Expression: Lambda functions can only contain a single expression. This makes them concise but less versatile than standard functions.
Scoped: They have their own local scope and cannot include statements (e.g., loops, assignments).
While useful for simple tasks, using lambda for complex operations can reduce code readability, so itâ€™s best suited for short, inline use cases.
